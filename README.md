# QuickRent Navbar and Drawer Menu

## Brief Description
This project demonstrates a responsive navigation bar and drawer menu built using **Next.js** and **JavaScript**, along with **Material-UI** for the drawer component. The following features are implemented:

- **Responsive Design**: The navbar adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries. On smaller screens, a hamburger menu is displayed, activating the drawer.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Navigation links change dynamically based on the user's signed-in status.
- **Modern Styling**: CSS provides hover effects, smooth transitions, and mobile-friendly layouts.
- **Drawer Menu**: A collapsible drawer is implemented for easy navigation on mobile devices.

This setup is ideal for platforms like QuickRent, where seamless navigation across devices is crucial.
